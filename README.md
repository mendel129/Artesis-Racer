**Artesis Racer **

One day, far far away, this game is going to be funny/nice/oldskool enought to play everywhere, on every device.
It's being written in c++ en OpenGL.

Anyway, it's just a fun project of a friend & myself.
Actually, it's an assignment... But hey! Why don't make something fun of it! Like a race game :-)

On this codeplex page you can follow our progress in the development of our racer...
